This is just a simple few lines of code to use the discord api to join / leave servers on a discord user accounts.

Use this at your own risk discord has brain cells and can see if you do this too many times (ban basically)

To get around a ban use proxies :)

note: this is setup to just work with the last 6 letters of the invite like! use a guild id to leave a guild!
